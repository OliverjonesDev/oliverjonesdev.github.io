                        <h4>This game was the third game I had developed in my first year at university and it was made during the 2 Week Adventure game-jam. I worked with an artist and we completed the game in about 9 days. This was a big change for me as
                            i've never worked in a team so I could focus more on the programming, and rest of the game. I think that the systems I developed worked very well for the game, and this is the first game that i've made that uses a fully functional
                            save game system. This forced me to learn about game data serialization and how to read and load data into and from json files. With a writer, and more art I think that this could be a very fun narrative game using the code
                            I developed as a foundation.
                            <br>
                            <br>Notable systems in place:
                            <br>Serialized game states
                            <br>JSON file reading for interactable objects allowed me to create files easily without having to load into the editor or use the unity inspector, I believe that this was a good design choice as If I had a writer on the team
                            they could easily create narrative cards and send them to me or create text files themself and impliment it into the game without having to need the editor or understand unity.
